# Fortgeschrittene Informationssicherheit
This project is a solution for the Fortgeschrittene Informationssicherheit (Advanced Information Security) course in the 5th semester in Fachhochschule Dortmund. The program is implemented in Java and focuses on various cryptographic algorithms and techniques to ensure data security. The solution includes implementations of ChaCha20, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), and several hashing algorithms.

The project demonstrates practical knowledge of cryptography, secure communication, and data integrity. It is designed to help students understand how modern encryption and security mechanisms are applied in real-world scenarios.
